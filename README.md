# Restaurant Order System

This project is a **Restaurant Order Management System** designed using Python. It implements an event-driven architecture to manage menu items, orders, and notifications efficiently. The system is modular, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Features

### 1. Menu Management
- Add new menu items with unique IDs, names, and prices.
- List all available menu items with their details.

### 2. Order Management
- Create new orders by selecting menu items by their IDs.
- Update the status of orders (e.g., Pending, Preparing, Completed, Delivered).
- List all existing orders with their current status.

### 3. Notification System
- Automatically generate notifications when an order is created.
- Notify users when the status of an order is updated.
- List all notifications generated by the system.

### 4. Event-Driven System
- An `EventBus` is used to handle communication between different components (menu, orders, notifications).
- This architecture ensures loose coupling and better scalability.

## File Structure

```plaintext
.
├── event_bus.py           # Core event-handling logic
├── menu_agent.py          # Handles menu-related operations
├── order_agent.py         # Manages order creation and updates
├── notification_agent.py  # Handles notifications for orders
├── main.py                # Entry point for the system
```

### File Details

1. **event_bus.py**:
   - Defines the `EventBus` class to manage event subscriptions and publications.
   - Ensures seamless communication between components through a publish-subscribe pattern.

2. **menu_agent.py**:
   - Contains the `MenuItem` class for menu item definition.
   - Functions to add new items to the menu and list all menu items.

3. **order_agent.py**:
   - Contains the `Order` class to represent customer orders.
   - Functions to create new orders, update their status, and list all orders.

4. **notification_agent.py**:
   - Defines the `Notification` class to store messages related to orders.
   - Functions to create notifications and list all notifications.

5. **main.py**:
   - Integrates all components and exposes them as callable functions.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pydantic
  ```

### Running the System
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Execute the `main.py` file in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Import the modules in an interactive Python session or integrate them into a larger project.

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Menu Item
```python
from menu_agent import MenuItem, add_menu_item
item = MenuItem(id=1, name="Pizza", price=12.99)
response = add_menu_item(item)
print(response)
```

### Listing Menu Items
```python
from menu_agent import list_menu
response = list_menu()
print(response)
```

### Creating an Order
```python
from order_agent import Order, create_order
order = Order(id=1, items=[1])
response = create_order(order)
print(response)
```

### Updating Order Status
```python
from order_agent import update_order_status
response = update_order_status(order_id=1, new_status="Completed")
print(response)
```

### Listing Notifications
```python
from notification_agent import list_notifications
response = list_notifications()
print(response)
```

## How It Works

1. **Menu Management**:
   - Menu items are stored in an in-memory list.
   - Each menu item has a unique ID, name, and price.

2. **Order Processing**:
   - Orders are created by selecting menu item IDs.
   - Each order has a unique ID and tracks its status (e.g., Pending, Preparing).

3. **Notifications**:
   - Notifications are generated whenever an order is created or its status is updated.
   - Notifications are stored in an in-memory list and can be retrieved anytime.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - The `EventBus` class ensures smooth communication between components using event-driven programming.
   - Events are published when orders are created or updated, triggering the creation of notifications.
